Awww the good old shell. These days it doesn't matter what you are doing, the UNIX shell is always around. Wether we work as web developers, iOS developers, Android developers, Data Scientists. At some point we will have to use it.

The first time I saw that shell prompt I found it intimidating. First of all, you can't move freely around, you have to use your arrow keys. Secondly, you can only work line by line which means if you break something it can be hard to redo things, especially when you delete things (thats why we have Graphical User Interfaces).

While there seem to be a bazillion UNIX commands and combinations, there are really just a few which everyone should know to get around. The rest, one should learn based on specific needs. And even tho opening a shell window might seem tedious at first, soon it will become your preferred way of working with your computer.

# The most Basic UNIX Commands

Ok so enough talking, lets tackle the problem, learning UNIX commands. Among the most used one's for everyday tasks are these commands:

- ls (list items in directory)
- pwd (show current directory)
- cd (change directory)
- touch (create empty file)
- grep (search output)
- cat (print file content)
