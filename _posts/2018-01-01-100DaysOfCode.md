As the days progress I will keep this blog post up to date as a change log to keep track of what I did on each day of the challenge.

## Day 0: January 1st

Today I started a Calculator Project using Plain Javascript, the main challenge were not the operations but working with the UI. Some of the main problems were:

* update the numbers typed in and the result at the right time
* get the right values from the button
* differentiate between numbers and operators as well special operators (=, remove)
* validate the input so that the app doesn't end up with multiple operators (ex: +++-4)

I have to say that day after day, I'm starting to feel more comfortable using Javascript with ES6 syntax.

## Day 1: January 2nd
