Over the past years Data science has become increasingly important throughout different industries. Which is why I'm writing this post to collect valuable information which will aid anyone to learn about this topic. Most of the information presented here will be taken from different which I will list at the bottom under the reference section.

# Basics

Data Science is all about acquiring knowledge from Data. Data itself is a collection of information which can be:

- Organized Data: in some form of row/column structure
- Unorganized Data: in free form like text

The ultimate goal is to use the new knowledge to do something like predicting, making decisions, etc. In the past it used to be that people would crunch data and analyze it but this is no longer possible due to the size of the data today. That is why we need Data Science.

Data Science consists of three basic areas which work together (consult: Venn Diagram):

1. Math/Statistics: formula for analysis
2. Programming: perform analysis
3. Domain knowledge: understanding of the field (ex. Medicine)

### Common Vocabulary:
- **Machine Learning:** computer ability to learn from data.
- **Probabilistic Model:** use of probability to find relationship between elements
- **Statistical Model:** use Statistical theorems to formalize the relationships.
- **Data Mining:** find relationships between elements
