I started blogging years ago when I was in highshool. It never became something
coninstent and I must have started like a dozen of blogs about my different
hobbies. I have exprience using Blogger and Wordpress (paid and free). If I
would have known Jekyll existed I would have used it from day one but I didn't
know how to program 3-5 years ago. My point is that Jekyll is a really great
blogging tool (my favorite) if you are willing to learn a little.

I knew about Jekyll for about a year now but I never tried doing something with
it. This Christmass weekend I worked my way through the docs and learned how
incredible Jekyll is.

### Why Jekyll is awesome

1. You get free hosting on github
2. You have full control of the HTML and CSS (template)
3. You can add dynamic functionality fairly easy
4. And you get a nice pool of plugin options (free)

So lets go through everything step by step:

## Installing & Creating a Blog

Before we install Jekyll we need Ruby and already you are presented with
different options, for now lets assume you have it installed and if not I
highly recommend you use a Ruby Version Manager like
[__rbenv__](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [__rvm__](https://rvm.io/).
Read about both, chose one and install Ruby 2.2 (or higher).

Once you have Ruby installed we can install Jekyll which is just a
[Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/):
Open Terminal:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
jekyll new my-blog
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Ok, so  we installed 2 gems: `jekyll` and `bundler`. We already know what
Jekyll is. As for Bundler:

> Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking
> and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.

It installs gems and does all the dependency management for you which means
less time coding (debugging).

Now that we installed, created and even executed our blog, we can take a look
at `localhost:4000` and you should see your blog running.  Now lets quite the
server and take a look at everything.

First of all, in Jekyll you are presented with 2 options:

1. You create everything from scratch (no themes)
2. You can chose a theme ([Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/))

At my first run I installed Jekyll and tried building everything from scratch
using Bootstrap CDN and design a quick skeleton but I soon noticed that life is
easier if you use a theme and customize everything afterward. I went ahead and
chose the __[basically basic](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic)__
theme.  We are going to build everything from scratch. The folder/file structure
is pretty much the same. Jekyll doesn't create everything so you have to create
the missing files and folders:

```bash
.gitignore
404.html
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
_config.yml
_posts/
_includes/ # partials go here
_layouts/
_sass/
index.md # your entry point
```

This is how  a basic Jekyll project looks like. For the most past each file and
folder describes itself.
Finally let's remove the default theme with which our blog comes in
`_config.yml`. For that remove this line:

```yaml
theme: minima
```

## Layouts & Includes

Currently all our content is served from the `index.md` file (`post` layout).
We could write all our HTML in here but if we add a new page, we would end up
writing the same HTML all over again. Instead Jekyll lets us create `layouts`
inside the `layouts/` folder. Layouts are templates that we can create where we
add everything that doesn't change. We can create different layouts and usually
you will want to create a default one and then one for every other purpose.

### default.html

The default layout has all the HTML that EVERY page is going to need.
For example, the HTML tags, header, body, footer. Usually you only want to
really change the body which is where you will render your posts, categories,
custom content, etc.
for example a default.html file could look like this:

```html
<!-- my-blog/_layouts/default.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/stylesheets/main.css">
</head>

<body>
 {{ content }}
 <script async src="/assets/javascripts/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

As you can see everything around the `content` keyword will be served on every
page that choses to use this layout. `content` is a special keyword/variable
that Jekyll replaces later with our content. Now that we created our default
layout, we can create another layout which is a little more special, called
`post.html`:

```html
---
layout: default
---
<!-- my-blog/_layouts/post.html -->
<main id="main">
{% raw %}
 {{ content }}
{% endraw %}
</main>
```

All we did was create a new layout which will render our `content` (blog post).
The only difference is that we added `front-matter` (those dashes '-' at the
top) which is just a small configuration of the layout before it is created.
Jekyll always looks at the `front-matter` and processes it. Inside the
`front-matter` you can specify customization variables and values to your
layout. In this case, we are just setting the layout we want to use. That is
right, a layout can depend on another layout. This means that our `<main>` tag
and its `content` will be inserted into our `default.html` layout. Which gives
us flexibility. If we want we can create now an `about.html` layout with the
same logic:

```html
---
layout: default
---
<!-- my-blog/_layouts/about.html -->
<h2>MY ABOUT PAGE</h2>
{% raw %}
 {{ content }}
{% endraw %}
```

This is all great but when do we render our actual content ? At the root of our
project we can create an `about.html`
All we have to add to the file is this:

```html
---
layout: about
---
<!-- my-blog/about.html -->
<h3>
 This will be rendered as content inside the about layout
 and then inside the default layout
</h3>
```

If we start our server we will that the `localhost:4000/about` renders All the
HTML we wrote in default.html, Jekyll inserted our `<h2>` tag from the
about.html layout and finally it added our `<h3>` tag from about.html file in
our root directory.

Similar to layouts, includes lets us include html partials into our content. We
can create a small HTML snippet in our `_includes/` folder and insert it
anywhere we want. For that lets create a `greeting.html` file in our
`_includes/` folder:

```html
<!-- my-blog/_includes/greeting.html -->
<h1>HELLO EVERYONE</h1>
```

Now we can include that HTML snippet where ever we want using the include tag
like this:

```html
---
layout: about
---
<!-- my-blog/about.html -->
<h3>
 This will be rendered as content inside the about layout
 and then inside the default layout
</h3>
{% raw %}
  {% include greeting.html %}
{% endraw %}
```

If we reload the about page, we can see our `<h1>` with our greeting appear.
And with that we learned how to keep our HTML clean and lean. Both layouts and
includes are crucial to make our blogging experience simpler.

## Learning Liquid

So far, we have seen these curly braces everywhere and some tags like
`include` and `content` but where do those come from ? Well it turns out they
belong to the [Liquid Template Language](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) which
lets you execute code and add a certain dynamic to our templates. Thanks to them
we can simply tell Jekyll where we want it to render our Post content instead of
rewriting all the HTML for every single post. So lets cover the basics.

{% highlight html%}
{% raw %}
everything in {{ }} gets outputted
{{ content }}

everything in {% content %} gets evaluated but not outputted
this for example would not render our content
{% content %}

we can create variables like this:
{% assign my_variable = false %}

and we can check conditions using if,
ex: we can show our content if my_variable is true
{% if my_variable %}
 {{ content }}
{% endif %}

we can loop through a list
which we will use a lot
to display each of our posts

{% for product in collection.products %}
 {{ product.title }}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

For the most part, this is what you will be using the most. For a full list and
documentation visit the [Liquid](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) GitHub blog.
There you can see how you can use filters to manipulate your content and much
more.

## How to use variables

We have seen how to assign variables in liquid but Jekyll lets us also create
`site` and `local` variables. Our site variables are defined inside our
`_config.yml` file like this: `title: My Blog Title` to use these variables we
use the liquid curly braces and the site scope like this `site.title` which will
display the blog title. Similar you can add your twitter handle, email,
description, many more things.

Apart from those site wide accessible variables Jekyll lets us define local
variables for each of our posts which are accessible in our layouts. To assign
variables in our post we use the `front-matter`. For instance we can set a title
inside the front-matter the same we set the layout:`title: My blog title`. We
can use them in our post layout like this: `page.title`. As you can see, we know
every post will have a title but our layout can't know beforehand the title so
we declare it inside our post's front-matter and the layout can use that to
dynamically display the post's title for every post.

## Writing Posts
All blog posts in Jekyll have a fixed format. We create them inside your
`_posts/` folder with this format. We have to use 4 digits for the year, 2
digits for the month and 2 digits for the day separated by a dash each.
Generally they are all either markdown files or html files.

```bash
YYYY-MM-DD
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.html
```

## What are plugins

Plugins like in Wordpress are small add ons that add functionality. In the case
of Jekyll you they are more geared towards developers such as `sass-converter`,
`coffescript`, `GitHub gists`, etc. My favorite for now is
[Jekyll admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin) which lets you add posts
and manage your Jekyll blog via a GUI like Wordpress and Blogger.

For a more extensive list, take a look at this repository:

[awesome-jekyll-plugins](https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-plugins)

and the Jekyll [Plugins section](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#available-plugins)

## How to deploy

Depending on where you plan to deploy you have to a few changes.
For this tutorial I assume you want to deploy to Github. In the case of github
you have to go to your Gemfile and replace Jekyll with Githubs own version of
Jekyll:

```ruby
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
```

Then run bundle install again.

For full deployment instructions read [Github's](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) tutorial which is always
up to date.

As a final step I encourage you to copy the
[__basically basic__](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic)
theme I mentioned and go through the installation. Try customizing it and apply
your new knowledge.
