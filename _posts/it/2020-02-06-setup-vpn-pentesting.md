A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public
network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public
networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private
network.

Before setup the VPN on our machine, we have to configure our DNS settings.

```bash
nano /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

# inside the file uncomment this line and add a public DNS server such as
# www.opendns.com and save the file
prepend domain-name-servers IP_ADDR_01, IP_ADDR_02;

# restart your network-manager
service network-manager restart

# check that the DNS servers have been added
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Now that we have our DNS server setup we have to disable WebRTC in our browser.
For that, we open it and type **about:config** in the search bar. Once the
menu opens, search for **media.peerconnection.enabled** and make sure its set to
false.

We are ready to download a free VPN like [vpnbook.com](www.vpnbook.com).
Before we install it, make sure that the browser is completly closed and open
the terminal. Navigate to the directory where the vpn downloaded.

```bash
cd Downloads/

unzip vpn_book_file.zip

# start vpn service
openvpn vpnbook-whatever.ovpn
```
