# Increase Web app performance

As we develope Web Apps we tend to hit performance bottlenecks along the way and while sometimes they are not as terrible they can slow down our Web App considerably and can consume a lot of data which isn't great. There are some key areas we can focus on to increase drastically the performance of our Web Apps:

- [Google Maps bottleneck](#google-maps-bottleneck)
- [Loading Images Lazy](#loading-images-lazy)
- [Minify CSS & Javascript](#minify-css-and-javascript)
- [Serve assets using Service Worker](#serve-assets-using-service-worker)
- [IndexedDB is not that terrible](#indexeddb-is-not-that-terrible)


## Google Maps bottleneck

A lot of websites these days use google maps to display their store location or to indicate where something is happening but few users know just how much google maps decreases the performance of a Website. It seems rather simple to copy and paste a pregenarated map into our HTML and 1,2,3 we have a map but Google map is resource hungry. The way google maps loads is that it loads several smaller images (tiles) to generate the whole map you requested and it also loads a few scripts. Unfortunetly those images can take some time to load especially in HTTP 1.0.

The solution to this problem is rather simple:
1. place it at the bottom where it gets rendered later
2. use a toggle button/image to load the map only when the user actually needs it

Personally I prefer option 2 as it actually stops the map from loading the individual tiles and gives the user the option to chose. The way you archive this effect is simple. Place your google HTML snippet inside a `div` and give that `div` a style of `display:none`. This means that the user won't use the map but it will be loading the Javascript in the back just not the images.

{%- highlight html -%}
<div id="map-container" style="display:none">
  <!-- the map goes here -->
</div>

<div onclick="showMap(this)">
  <img src="palceholder-image.png">
</div>
{%- endhighlight -%}

I usually use a dummy image of a map which is scaled up a lot which gives it a blurred effect. The replacement image itself is just 15kb large and when the user clicks the image, I change the styling to `display:block` for the map and `display:none` for the image.

{%- highlight javascript -%}
function showMap(placeholder) {
  let mapContainer = document.getElementById('map-container');
  mapContainer.style.display = 'block';
  placeholder.style.display = 'none';
}
{%- endhighlight -%}

## Loading Images Lazy
## Minify CSS and Javascript
## Serve assets using Service Worker
## IndexedDB is not that terrible
