# Increase Web app performance

As we develop Web Apps we tend to hit performance bottlenecks along the way and while sometimes they are not as terrible they can slow down our Web App considerably and can consume a lot of data which isn't great. There are some key areas we can focus on to increase drastically the performance of our Web Apps:

## Google Maps bottleneck

A lot of websites these days use google maps to display their store location or to indicate where something is happening but few users know just how much google maps decreases the performance of a Website. It seems rather simple to copy and paste a pre-generated map into our HTML and 1,2,3 we have a map but Google map is resource hungry. The way google maps loads is that it loads several smaller images (tiles) to generate the whole map you requested and it also loads a few scripts. Unfortunately those images can take some time to load especially in HTTP 1.0.

The solution to this problem is rather simple:
1. place it at the bottom where it gets rendered later
2. use a toggle button/image to load the map only when the user actually needs it

Personally I prefer option 2 as it actually stops the map from loading the individual tiles and gives the user the option to chose. The way you archive this effect is simple. Place your google HTML snippet inside a `div` and give that `div` a style of `display:none`. This means that the user won't use the map but it will be loading the Javascript in the back just not the images.

{%- highlight html -%}
<div id="map-container" style="display:none">
  <!-- the map goes here -->
</div>

<div onclick="showMap(this)">
  <img src="palceholder-image.png">
</div>
{%- endhighlight -%}

I usually use a dummy image of a map which is scaled up a lot which gives it a blurred effect. The replacement image itself is just 15kb large and when the user clicks the image, I change the styling to `display:block` for the map and `display:none` for the image.

{%- highlight javascript -%}
function showMap(placeholder) {
  let mapContainer = document.getElementById('map-container');
  mapContainer.style.display = 'block';
  placeholder.style.display = 'none';
}
{%- endhighlight -%}

## Loading Images Lazy

Browsers load all images by default. This behaviour makes it easy to build websites but at the same time it makes sites less responsive. We cannot just ditch image loading all together but it would be wise to prioritize the images that are above the fold and lazy load the rest of the images (when the user scrolls). This sounds great but how do we do this ?

This is where the `Intersection Observer API` comes into play. This API enables us to tell when an HTML element enters the view and leaves it. We do this by adding an element to our observer API.

When we create our images we cannot add the `src` attribute just yet or else the Browser will fetch the image immediately which we don't want. Instead we add a `data-src` attribute which will store the image link for later:

{%- highlight html -%}
<img class='image-class-name' data-src='ourImage.png'>
{%- endhighlight -%}

Now we can write the javascipt needed to notify us when the images enter the view:

{%- highlight javascript -%}
const images = document.querySelectorAll('.image-class-name');
let observer = new IntersectionObserver(onIntersection, config);
images.forEach(image => {
  observer.observe(image);
});

function onIntersection(element) {
const images = document.querySelectorAll(".your-classname");
  element.forEach(elem => {
   if (elem.intersectionRatio > 0) {
    observer.unobserve(elem.target);
    preloadImage(elem.target);
   }
  };
};
{%- endhighlight -%}

A quick walkthrough, first we are gathering all our images with the class `.image-class-name`. Next we create our `IntersectionObserver` and finally we loop through our images and add tell our observer to notify us when these images enter the view. The `onIntersection` function gets called when the image or images [it can be an array] enter the view. The image is past into our function as the first parameter. This element is an array so we loop through it (it can be 1 as well as 100 images). We make sure that the element is without our desired view and then we tell our observer to unobserve our image so that we don't fetch the same image more than once. Finally we load our image.

With a few lines of javascript we were able to lazy load our images. Now as the user scrolls our site, our images will load dynamically which means less Data consumption for our mobile users and a faster page speed.


## Minify CSS and Javascript

Assets such as CSS and Javascript have to be minified or uglyfied. Personally I like injecting my minified CSS into the head with a style tag if my CSS is small to reduce unnecesary requests and to speed up the paint of the site. Javascript should be minified and added inside the body tag using an `async` and/or `defer` attribute to improve the way it is loaded. There are several tools available for this such Webpack and Parcel or the old school Gulp and Grunt. Especially CSS increases the pages "Firs meaningful paint" time which will reduce your performance quite a bit.
