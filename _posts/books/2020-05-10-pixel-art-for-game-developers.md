## Why Pixel Art ?

Pixel art was created due to technical restraints. However, players love pixel
pixel art due to nostalgia and the simplicity leads to memorable and iconic
imagery. Pixel art games use a highly accepted game style.

Each pixel conveys as much information as possible which leads to iconic art
where features are exagerated.

> Pixel art looks intentional and timeless

For game developers, pixel art makes life easier. Sprites are literally pixel
sized resulting in tiny file sizes. They are somehat easy to create and the
software needed to make them is cheap. It is easy to import into games and it
works well on small screens.

Compared to 3D, the design process is much simpler. Thus there are various
reasons to use pixel art in our games.

## Drawing Pixel Art

When drawing lines, focus on drawing straight lines or lines that follow a
consistent pattern. An important aspect of creating curves is to avoid lone
pixels as they break the ilusion of a curve. A line should always be 1 pixel
wide otherwise it turns aestheticly unpleasent.

> When important pixel images reduce/disable anti-aliasing. While on normal
> images/assets it can be useful to soften the image for pixel art where every
> pixel counts it can easily turn our drawings blurry.
