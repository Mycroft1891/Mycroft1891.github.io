## 1 Introduction to Computer Science

Programming is not the same same as Computer Science it is a tool to implement
Computer Science concepts. While Programming languages come and go the
underlying algorithms are the most important thing as they can be applied to
any programming language. It is important to understand that computers only do
what they are explicitly told.

Computer Science is about problem solving:

1. Understand the problem
2. Write out a solution in plain english
3. Translate it to code
4. Test the code on the computer

## 2 How does the Computer really work

Understanding the underlying machinary of computers enables us to develope more
efficient software. Digital Computers consists mainly of:

- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Memory Unit
- Control Unit
- Peripheral (mass storage, UI devices)

> Most computers today are based on the Von Neumann model computing

Memory stores content as numbers (radix - positional representation). Memory is
built from cells where each cell has its own address (cell = byte). Each cell
hold up to 8 bits or 1 byte.

There are two types of memory:

1. RAM (Random Access Memory)
2. Mass Storage (SSD/HHD)

Mass Storages are measured in special units: kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte,
Terabyte. Computers are based on radix of 2 (2^10 = 1024). All binary prefixes
and names were codified by the IEEE as a standar in 2005.

> The abbreviation for kilo (k) is written in lowercase because the uppercase
> (K) is a reserved letter for temperature measurement in Kelvin

Programs are operated by a Control Unit which executes intructions in logical
sequencial manner. Each execution is controlled by a time mechanism called a
clock. A Clock operates in frequencies (time step) and is measured in Hertz (Hz
 where 1 Hz = 1 clock cycle per second.

Clock speed is not a good way of camparing performance across computers because
of the overlap between phases of instructions and because different
instructions take a different number of clock cycles. Therefore, FLOPS
(Floating point operations) and MIPS (Million of instructions per second)
measure instruction rate rather than time per instruction. As processing power
increases the access of data in memory dominates the speed of execution which
is why newer approaches are introduced (ex. gigateps)

Memory consists of string of bits (Bytes) which can be stringed together to
form longer strings. The Control Unit can decode and execute strings of bits
which results in instructions leading to new instructions. The same bits can
also hold data.

> Unicode: character and non character-based texts standard consisting of
> 1-4 bytes per item

Computers execute code by compiling or interpreting it. Compilation consists of
a compiler that analyzes a program for statements and produces a file with
executable instructions. Interpretation consists of an interpreter that
analyzes statements and executes them as it encounters them. Pure
interpretation doesn't produce instructions for the computer only effects.

> Ruby support 2 types of interpretation: __interactive mode__ where you type
> one statement at the time and __batch mode__ where you create a file and the
> interpreter analyzes it for instructions.

## 3 Core Programming Elements

> For Ruby Installation instructions read this [post](/installing-ruby)

In programming a variables is a  piece of data attached to a name. Most
programming languages declare variables like in algebra `variable_name =value`.
It is a good practice to give variables a meaningful name and avoid special
characters. If you want to use multiple words for your variables name use a `_`
to join them. Variables store a value at a given memory location. While
variables can change constants allow us to declare unchangeable variables.

Variables can have different data types and each data type needs a different
amount of memory allocated. In Ruby data types are defined as Classes. The most
common Data Types are as follows:

- Integer: possitive or negative number
- Float: decimal number
- String: one or more characters surrounded by quotes (' or ")
- Boolean: true or false value

Ruby will always try to remain in the same data type as such we have to do the
conversion to ensure that the operation we want to do are doable.

It is common to do mathematical operations which why ruby supports binary
operations (`+, -, *, /, %, **` ). Ruby has a module for more complex
mathmatical operations `Math.sin(1) or Math::PI` . I/O in Ruby is archived
through `gets` and `puts`.

When designing a program it is important to follow certain steps to design well:

1. Understand the problem
2. Write out the problem in plain english
3. Rewrite the problem into code
4. Test out the code on the computer

No matter how good we design our programs errors will pop up. There are mainly
2 types of errors:

1. Syntax Error:  code that ruby cannot execute
2. Logical Error: error that ruby cannot catch  => wrong/undesired result

## 4 Conditional Structures

Every algorithm has some type of logic flow also known as
**Flow of Execution**. Conditional flow allows us to have more than one flow
option. This is accomplished through expressions using boolean operators
(true/false) and relations. We can combine various simple expressions to create
complex expressions. In order to do this we can use the **and** and **or**
boolean operators in Ruby. Furthermore we can flip the boolean value of any
expression using the **!** sign. These operations allow us to alter the logic
flow in a program.

At the top of these expressions we have **if/elsif/else** statements which use
the expressions to determine how the program flows.

```ruby
if condition
 # do something
elsif other_condition
 # something else
else
 # default case
end
```

The condition represents the logical expressions we discussed earlier. It is
possible to chain multiple **elsif** statements to create even complexer logic
flow but this becomes increasinly tideous to write and read. A better statement
for these situations is a **case** statement:

```ruby
age = 12
case
when age > 12
 puts 'You are older than 12'
when age < 12
 puts 'You are younger than 12'
then
 puts 'You are 12'
end
```

or on a single line as follows:

```ruby
age = 12
case age
when 13 then puts 'You are older than 12'
when 11 then puts 'You are younger than 12'
else puts 'You are 12'
end
```

As the logic flow increases in complexity, it is important to debug our
applications effectively. A simple option would be to use **puts** statements
everywhere we expect the value of a variable to change. A slightly better
options would be to use **Debug Flags** which are global variables that allow
us to specify if our code is running in debug mode or not and only then
increase our application log level using puts statments:

```ruby
DEBUG_MODE = true

name = 'Alexander'
#expext name = ["A", "l", "e", "x", "a", "n", "d", "e", "r"]
name.split

puts name  if DEBUG_MODE
#real value of name is ["alexander"]
```

## 5 Loop Structures

There are three types of loops in Ruby:

1. while loop
2. until loop
3. for loop

Loops iterate or repeat commands. The **While**  loop is the simplest since it
keeps looping while the condition is true:

```ruby
i = 0
while i < 10 do
 puts i
 i += 1
end
```

On the other hand, the **Until** keeps looping until the condition is true.
Hence is it as simple as flipping the comparison operator:

```ruby
i = 0
until i > 10 do
 puts i
 i += 1
end
```

The **For** loop is different altogether as this loop takes a group of elements
and loops through all of them. It is possible to nest this loop as well which
comes in handy for multidimentional arrays.

```ruby
integer_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in integer_list do
 puts i
end
```

A common mistakes programmers make with loops is to create an infinite loop.
This happens when there is no exit condition or the exit condition is never
met. This is where **For** loops are handy as they will only loop while there
are elements to loop over.

## 6 Arrays

## 7 Sorting and Searching

Computers spend a tremendous amount sorting. Sorting itself is a problem that
is described as followed:

> Given a list of elements in any order reorder them so that they appear
> according to their ordinal value from lowest to highest.

```text
5,3,2,4,3,2,1
```

Given the above sequence we can use several sorting algorithms to solve this
problem:

1. Selection Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Radix Sort

### Selection Sort O(n)

This is the simplest sort algorithm. You pick the smallest number and move it
to the beginning of the list and you repeat this process until the list is
sorted. You would take these steps for this algorithm:

1. Mark list as unprocessed
2. Find the smallest element and put it at the beginning
3. Repeat step 2 for n - 2 times

### Insertion Sort O(nÂ²)

This algorithm works by inserting the number at its right position. These would
be the steps you would have to take:

1. Considering the first element, the list is sorted
2. Take the second element and insert it at its position keeping it sorted
3. repeat step 2 until the entire list is sorted.

### Bubble Sort O(n)

This algorithm works by repetitively comparing adjacent pairs of cards in the
list. This sorting algorithm uses two loops. The outer loops makes sure the
process runs **n - 1** times while the inner loop is responsible to loop though
the list. If the current element is bigger than the element on the right swap
them. You would take these steps:

1. Loop through all entries in the list
2. Compare each entry to all successive entries and swap if out of order
3. Repeat this process a total of n - 1 times.

### Radix Sort O(dn)

This algorithm works by sorting by successive digits. This way we sort first
all the ones digits then the tens digit and so on. This means we first sort
the right most digit, then the tens, then the hudreds, etc.

```ruby
[47, 21, 90] # unsorted
[90, 21, 47] # right most digit is sorted
[21, 47, 90] # the second digit is sorted
# and we are done
```

Each algorithm can be evaluated by analyzing its complexity. Assuming that each
element takes one unit of time how many units of time are required to process a
list of **n sized** elements. We use the **on the order of** or the
**big oh (O)** notation to note the complexity of an algorithm. For example
**O(nÂ²)** means that the complexity grows exponantially in relation to **n** or
the size of the list.

Another common task computers perform frequently and which build on the sorting
algorithms we just learned is searching. When searching a list there are 2 very
important questions we must ask ourselves:

1. Is the list sorted ?
2. Are the elements unique ?

We will go through two types of searches:

**Linear Search O(n)** is used for unsorted lists. It will just go through the
list in a linear fashion and compares each element to the value we are searching
until it finds it. In the worst case it will loop though the entire list.

**Binary Search O(logâ(n))** is used for sorted lists. The approach is similar
to how you would search a phone book. Assuming it is sorted from A-Z we can
start at the middle. If the name we look for on the left we look there
otherwise we look at the right half. Once again this a rinse and repeat process
until we find the name we look for.
