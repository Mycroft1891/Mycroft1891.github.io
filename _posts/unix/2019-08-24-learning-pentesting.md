A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test, pentest or ethical
hacking, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed
to evaluate the security of the system. The test is performed to identify
both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential
for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data,
as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

## Environment Setup

In order to get our pentesting environment setup we need a virtualization
software which will allow us to install [kali](https://www.kali.org) or
[parrot](https://parrotlinux.org) on it. It is best to use a virtualization
software instead of installing it directly on a computer because if the virtual
enviroment gets infected with anything or something brakes we can easily either
rollback or discard the machine entirely.

For our purpose, we will use [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) for two
reasons. First, its open source and free. Second, it supports more features such
as unlimited snapshots which will come in handy when we want to rollback to a
previous state of our virtual machine.

## Basic Terminology

In order to get started we first have to cover some basic terminology which we
will use across our pentesting career.

## Learning the Linux terminal

Next we need to learn about the different commands at our disposal when working
on our linux distribution:
