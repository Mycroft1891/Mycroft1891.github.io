A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test, pentest or ethical
hacking, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed
to evaluate the security of the system. The test is performed to identify
both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential
for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data,
as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

## Environment Setup

In order to get our pentesting environment setup we need a virtualization
software which will allow us to install [kali](https://www.kali.org) or
[parrot](https://parrotlinux.org) on it. It is best to use a virtualization
software instead of installing it directly on a computer because if the virtual
enviroment gets infected with anything or something brakes we can easily either
rollback or discard the machine entirely.

For our purpose, we will use [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) for two
reasons. First, its open source and free. Second, it supports more features such
as unlimited snapshots which will come in handy when we want to rollback to a
previous state of our virtual machine.

## Basic Terminology

In order to get started we first have to cover some basic terminology which we
will use across our pentesting career.

## Learning the Linux terminal

Next we need to learn about the different commands at our disposal when working
on our linux distribution:

[Learning Unix commands](/learning-unix-commands)

## Installing Tor

Tor is a fantastic way of staying anonymous. It routes your traffic through all
the connected devices also called a network. Each node adds a layer of ecryption
making it very tough to track the source of the attack. The ultimate goal is to
`torify` our applications so their access is routed through the tor network
adding all these layers and making us anonymous.

We can install Tor with a single command using the terminal:

```bash
apt-get install tor -y
```

Now, we need to create a user so that we don't navigate as a root user. Type
the command below and follow the steps:

```bash
adduser test #or whatever you want
```

Then we have to change to our newly created user. Now we can download the tor
browser by navigating to `https://torproject.org`.

Once we installed the Tor Browser, we can start navigating the dark web. One of
the first things to search for is the `hiddenwiki` which is a place that
archives the onion domains of various usefull websites such as forums.
